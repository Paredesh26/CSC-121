'''
Step 1: Get the 1st route distance from the user.
Step 2: Get the speed of the route. miles per hour
Step 3: Ask user if they would like to add more routes. (Yes or No)
Step 4: If user says yes to adding more route repeat steps 1-3 until user answers no in step 3.
Step 5: When user says no in step 3, display the fastest route the user can take.
