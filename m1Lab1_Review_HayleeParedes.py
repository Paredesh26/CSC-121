'''
Step 1: Set up a control variable to start the program for a loop. 
Step 2: Set up a way for the program to keep running until user enters in no. 
Step 3: Get value/input from user about how many items they have.
Step 4: Use an if-else statement to get information on the cost per item based off of the number of items the user has.
Step 5: Calculate the total of all the items based off the cost per item and number of items.
Step 6: Display the cost per item.
Step 7: Display the total cost.
Step 8: Ask the user if they wish to run the program again.
Step 9: When user enters no, the program ends and displays to the user that the program is ending.
